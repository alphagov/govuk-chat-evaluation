# GOV.UK Chat Evaluation

## Results

This directory is intended for storing the results of an individual evaluation. The contents are purposefully git ignored.

Typically an individual result will contain data that allow re-running aspects of the evaluation. This includes a config file containing the configuration that was used for the evaluation and a file of the input dataset (including anything generated) which can be reused to run an evaluation again without re-generating the actual output.
