    def information_needs(input: str):
        return f"""You are given a user query directed to a UK government chatbot about content they expect to be reasonably available on GOV.UK.
            The user expects an answer that provides the key factual information or official details implied by their question.

            Your task: Extract the KEY INFORMATION NEEDS from the query.

            Each information need should represent an essential piece of government information that a good GOV.UK answer would provide in order to satisfy the query.

            The goal is to identify the *crucial pieces of information* that would allow the user to progress to the **next meaningful step** in their information journey.
            Do not include follow-up steps, secondary details, or additional actions that might come later. Focus only on the key facts or requirements the user needs to understand or decide what to do next.

            Guidelines:
            - Focus only on the central, key information needs — do not include secondary or tangential details.
            - Keep the scope within the kind of factual or procedural information GOV.UK would reasonably provide. Do not include personal or lifestyle advice.
            - Limit outputs to the **crucial elements** needed to move the user forward — not every possible step in a longer process.
            - For queries that ask for “help finding”, “show me”, or “GOV.UK guidance on …”, reduce the need to the *main topic* and the *type of information* sought (e.g., “rules for …”, “criteria to …”, “how to apply for …”).
            - Extract only what is explicitly or reasonably implied by the query itself. Do not add background knowledge or assumptions.
            - Break the query into distinct, answerable components only if the question clearly implies multiple aspects of official guidance.
            - Output must be valid JSON only, with the key `"information_needs"` mapped to a list of strings.
            - Do not include any explanation, commentary, or extra fields outside the JSON.

            Examples:

            1. Query:
            "Can I get financial help for my heating bills?"

            JSON:
            {{
                "information_needs": [
                "The government schemes available to help with heating or energy bills.",
                "Eligibility criteria for receiving heating bill support."
                ]
            }}

            2. Query:
            "How do I register as a landlord?"

            JSON:
            {{
                "information_needs": [
                "The legal requirements and process for registering as a landlord."
                ]
            }}

            3. Query:
            "What support is available for childcare costs while studying at university?"

            JSON:
            {{
                "information_needs": [
                "The types of financial support available for childcare costs.",

    def truths(retrieval_context: list):
        return f"""You will be given a list of strings.
            Each string has two elements:
            1. "Context" – metadata such as the page title, description and headings.
            2. "Content" – the actual text from that page.

            Your task: From each string, extract a list of factual statements ("facts") that can be inferred from the content, while retaining the contextual meaning provided by "Context".

            Guidelines:
            - Summarize the metadata in 'context'
            - Each fact must remain coherent and grounded in both the "Context" and the "Content".
            - Ensure the 'context' reflects the contextual meaning of the original string.
            - If the context limits the scope (e.g. "benefits in England"), ensure the facts reflect that scope.
            - Do not merge facts across different strings. Treat each string independently.
            - Do not add knowledge that is not present.
            - Output must be valid JSON only.

    def verdicts(information_needs: List[str], extracted_truths: List[str]):
        return f"""You will be given:
            1. A list of INFORMATION NEEDS (each describing a specific question or factual requirement from the user query).
            2. A structured list of TRUTHS extracted from the retrieval context.
            Each item in the TRUTHS list includes:
                - "context": metadata such as a page title or description (e.g. "Benefits in England")
                - "facts": a list of factual statements relevant to that context.

            Your task:
            For each information need, decide whether that need is **met by information in the retrieval context**.
            “Met” means that the retrieval context provides a clear and relevant answer to that need — **even if the answer itself is negative or says something is not possible.**

            Each information need should only be considered met if it is addressed by facts from a **relevant context**.
            Facts from a context that clearly does not apply (e.g. "Benefits in England" when the information need concerns "Scotland") should **not** be used as evidence of coverage.
            However, if the context is general (e.g. "UK-wide"), it may apply to any relevant region unless the information need specifies otherwise.

            For each information need, output a JSON object with two fields:
            - "verdict": one of "yes", "no", or "idk"
            - "reason": a brief explanation of why you chose that verdict, referring to relevant contextual facts when applicable.

            **Definitions:**
            - Use `"yes"` if one or more facts from a matching or relevant context clearly answer or satisfy the information need (even if the answer is “no,” “not eligible,” or expressed differently but equivalent in meaning).
            - Use `"no"` if the retrieval context does not contain any relevant facts addressing that information need, or if all available facts come from an irrelevant context.
            - Use `"idk"` if the information need or the contexts are too vague, conflicting, or incomplete to make a confident judgment.

            **Important:**
            The verdict labels do **not** reflect the truth value of the answer. They only indicate whether the information need is covered by the retrieval context.

            Expected JSON format:
            {{
                "verdicts": [
                    {{
                        "verdict": "yes",
                        "reason": "<explanation_for_why_the_need_is_fully_addressed_by_relevant_facts_in_the_context>"
                    }},
                    {{
                        "verdict": "no",
                        "reason": "<explanation_for_why_the_need_is_not_addressed_or_the_context_is_irrelevant>"
                    }},
                    {{

                    }}
                ]
            }}
