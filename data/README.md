# GOV.UK Chat Evaluation

## Data

This directory should contain input data for evaluation. The contents are purposefully git ignored as this data can be sensitive.

We have the data stored on [Google Drive](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tfgY8-5hCZDqw5zYAVpgYgB-VtjCKlzk1l1HMdOVV8U/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.9awg20g181xc) which AI Team members can access. It is expected that files from Google Drive will be saved to this directory to run an evaluation.
